/**
 * Problem: Rank of army officers given in an array. Ex {3, 4, 3, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0}. Any officer can report to a
 * superior officer with exactly one rank above his rank. multiple officers can report to same superior officer.
 * <p>
 * Find the number of officers who have a superior officer. Ex Answer = 5. because (2, 2, 3, 3, 3) have superior officer.
 *
 * Solution: Complexity O(NLog(N))
